    <h1>Code of conduct</h1>
    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
      We are a software developer / UX designer duo based in Edinburgh, Scotland.
      We have a track record of delivering end to end software solutions to the financial
      services sector, most notably working alongside <a href="http://www.robinfinch.com/">Mark Hoogenboom</a>
      to deliver the first iteration of the new
      <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.co.santander.santanderUK">Santander Android app</a>.
      We strive to develop simple solutions, with meaningful test coverage and responsive user interfaces.</p>

    <h2>People</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/samuel-kirton-5a394255/">Samuel Kirton</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/newtonangie/">Angie Newton</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>EOS deliverables</h2>
    <p>
      During August and September 2018 we developed <a href="https://github.com/memtrip/eos-jvm">eos-jvm</a>,
      an SDK for interacting with the EOS network on Android. These libraries were used to rapidly develop
      <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.memtrip.eosreach">EOS REACH</a>,
      an open source EOS wallet app for Android.
      <br /><br />
      We also put together a team with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/oisinoneill/">Oisin O'Neill</a> and
      <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/patrickmcclurg/">Patrick McClurg</a> for the EOS Global hackathon in London,
      where we came in third place as <a href="https://youtu.be/sGntXiVnRjg?t=24m15s"><i>On The Block</i></a>.
      We implemented a mobile first solution that has the potential to allow external parties to instantly
      verify what is effectively a user's credit rating, while keeping the data the user exposes to a minimum.
    </p>

    <h2>The future of EOS is on mobile</h2>
    <p>
      The current generation of browser plugin dependant DApps are not fit for
      mass market consumption, the average consumer has little interest in the
      fact that the products they use are running on top of a blockchain technology.
      We do not see a future for generic wallet apps as a gateway to Dapps running in web views,
      in comparison to native mobile experiences, the UX is slow and cumbersome.
      <br /><br />
      We envisage a second generation of Dapp developed natively for Android and iOS,
      slick mobile experiences that attempt to hide all knowledge of the underlying
      blockchain technology. This new generation of Dapps will utilise multisig,
      inter-blockchain communication, smart contracts and the decentralised nature of
      EOS to empower existing business processes.
      <br /><br />
      The possibilities are plentiful, and it all begins with a stable, consistent set
      of de facto libraries that streamline the error prone and labour intensive functions
      of interacting with a decentralised network.
    </p>

    <h2>Trust</h2>
    <p>
      We have been employed by, and have references from some of the leading financial services
      organisations in the United Kingdom, including; KPMG, Deloitte, RBS Group, Lloyds Banking Group and Clydesdale Bank.
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/EOSIO/eos/blob/5068823fbc8a8f7d29733309c0496438c339f7dc/constitution.md">
          We pledge to follow and uphold the EOS constitution.
        </a></li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Arbitration</h2>
    <p>
      We <strong>do not<strong> recognise <a href="https://eoscorearbitration.io/">ECAF</a> as
      the arbitration authority of the EOS blockchain. The only authority we answer to is
      executable code. With this being said, we will follow ECAF arbitration orders related to;
      configuration management, software syncronisation and key recovery. The only authority we
      answer to is the executable code and the EOS constitution. We are concerned that arbitration
      authorities have the potential to morph into centralsied institions, that have undue
      influence over the future direction of the EOS mainnet.
    </p>

    <h2>Block rewards</h2>
    <p>
      All block rewards will be reinvested in maintaining eos-jvm, expanding the
      functionality of EOS Reach on Android and used to kickstart EOS Reach for iOS.
      We are committed to open sourcing all the software we develop,
      letâ€™s build the future of EOS on mobile together!
